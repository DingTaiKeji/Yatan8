        <h3>Flash Firmware</h3>
        <p>If you wish to flash a different firmware or update Betaflight to the newest version, please follow these steps. </p>

        <p>1.Click the Firmware Flasher tab</p>
        <p>2.Select “SPRACINGF3EVO” as the board, and pick the version of Betaflight you wish to flash (latest is 3.0.1).</p>
        <p><img src="/assets/img/bf-flash-1.png" alt="" class="img-responsive"></p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Do not use “SPRACINGF3” or other targets. If no firmware is currently available do NOT attempt to flash. Flashing the wrong firmware can cause the FC to be permanently damaged.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>3.Click “Load firmware [Online]” and wait for firmware to download and read release notes before flashing.</p>
        <p>Now there are two situations.If you have lost communication with the board and no reboot sequence(also called bootloader) exit,you should do as following.</p>
        <p>a).Enable “No reboot sequence”,enable “Full chip erase”.</p>
        <p><img src="/assets/img/bf-flash-2.png" alt="" class="img-responsive"></p>
        <p>b).Jumper the BOOT pins and power on the board by connecting USB cable.Then remove the BOOT jumper.</p>
        <p><img src="/assets/img/fc-boot-pin.png" alt="" class="img-responsive"></p>
        <p>c).Now DFU will appear in the list of ports and flashing via DFU will available.Click “Flash Firmware”.After flashing the virtual COM port will appear as “COMxx”.</p>
        <p><img src="/assets/img/bf-flash-3.png" alt="" class="img-responsive"></p>
        <p>If reboot sequence(also called bootloader) exit and work well,you could flash the firmware without jumper the BOOT pins.This is the the state when the stock firmware works well and you want to upgrade to the latest version.Do as following.</p>
        <p>a).Disable “No reboot sequence”.</p>
        <p><img src="/assets/img/bf-flash-4.png" alt="" class="img-responsive"></p>
        <p>b).Power on the board by connecting USB cable.You could find the virtual COM port will appear on the up right corner.</p>
        <p>c).Click “Flash Firmware”.First,the board will reboot into DFU mode.Then wait the ST DFU DRIVER Automatic installation.It’s successfully installed when you see the DFU port on the up right corner.Now flashing via DFU will proceed.After flashing the virtual COM port will re-appear.</p>

        <p><strong>Q:</strong>Unable to flash firmware via DFU.</p>
        <p>Likely the correct DFU drivers are not installed. Put the board in BOOTLOADER mode (jump boot pins, connect USB cable). Then update DFU drivers.Here is the step:</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>Chrome may have problems automatically installed DFU driver for ST devices in DFU Mode on Windows.The solution is to replace the ST driver with a libusb driver. </p>
        <p>Download and launch <a href="http://zadig.akeo.ie" target="_blank">Zadig</a></p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>a).Options -> List All Devices</p>
        <p>b).Select STM32 Bootloader from the drop down.</p>
        <p>c).Choose WinUSB as the replacement.</p>
        <p>d).Click “Replace Driver”. Some times the Replace progress will be slow or no response, you can close it and do it again.</p>
        <p>e).Restart Chrome (make sure it is completely closed, logout and login if unsure)</p>
        <p>f).Now the DFU device should be seen by Configurator</p>
        <p><img src="/assets/img/bf-flash-5.png" alt="" class="img-responsive"></p>

        <p>Also you could see USB Flashing section of <a href="https://github.com/cleanflight/cleanflight/blob/master/docs/USB%20Flashing.md" target="_blank">Betaflight/Cleanflight manual</a> for details.</p>

        <p><strong>Q:</strong>The COM port does not show up.</p>
        <p>Ensure latest USB STM VCP (Virtual Com Port) drivers are installed.</p>

        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
        <p>Due to the overwhelming response from the customers, we have put together this FAQ to answer the most commonly asked questions.This section will grow as more and more members of the customers give us valuable feeedback and suggestions on how to improve the tune.</p>
        <p><strong><i class="fa fa-tags"></i>&nbsp;F3 Brushed Version</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Q:</strong>Can it handle 2S batteries?</p>
        <p>Yes,it supports 2s lipo battery,which could give you even more fierce racing experience than 1s.Bridge these two pins to support 2s battery as show below.</p>
        <p><img src="/assets/img/f3-brushed-1s-2s.jpg" alt="Components" class="img-responsive"></p>
        <p><strong>Q:</strong>Can it handle 8.5mm high-speed motors?</p>
        <p>Yes, the board can run 8.5mm motors.</p>
        <p><strong><i class="fa fa-tags"></i>&nbsp;F3 Brushed DSM Version</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Q:</strong>What radio control protocols are used by the board?</p>
        <p>The DSMX compatible version uses PPM 7 Channel that is compatible will all DSMX and DSM2 Spectrum radios.</p>
        <p>Any radio that can take the Orange Rx version module, such as the Turnigy 9X, is compatible with the DSMX version of the board.</p>
        <p><strong>Q:</strong>Can it handle 8.5mm high-speed motors?</p>
        <p>Yes, the board can run 8.5mm motors, but our recommendation is to use the 6mm size motors.</p>
        <p><strong>Q:</strong>Can it handle 2S batteries?</p>
        <p>No, it is designed to handle only 1S safely. Using higher cell batteries can damage the board.</p>
        <p><strong><i class="fa fa-tags"></i>&nbsp;General</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Q:</strong>What Flight Modes does it have?</p>
        <p>The board runs the popular Cleanflight/Betaflight firmware that is fully customizable and includes several different modes: Auto-Level, Horizon (auto-leveling mode with ability to flip), and full manual (rate). You can also enable AirMode and be able to control the quad at any speed and attitude</p>
        <p><strong>Q:</strong>What is the size of the motor micro JST plugs?</p>
        <p>The board uses the JST 1.25 2 pin style plug</p>
        <p><strong>Q:</strong>Does it have Altitude Hold?</p>
        <p>No, we are focused on making this board the lightest and most agile that it  can be, and are excluding extra features such as altitude hold for the time being.</p>
        <p><strong>Q:</strong>Any experience loading Betaflight onto it?</p>
        <p>You could follower this <a href="https://github.com/Crazepony/others/blob/master/How%20to%20Flash%20Firmware%20for%20F3%20EVO%20Flight%20Controller.pdf" target="_blank">user manual</a> to flash Beraflight firmware to the fc.This is the stardand process to flash F3 EVO fc.The followring image shows the Newest BF firmware we tested.</p>
        <p><img src="/assets/img/f3-brushed-betaflight-3.png" alt="Components" class="img-responsive"></p>
        <p>After the Betaflight firmware is flashed successfully,you need a little bit setup.</p>
        <p>If the version of Betaflight you have is 3.0 or above,change ESC/Motor protocol to BRUSHED on the Configuration Tab.</p>
        <p><img src="/assets/img/f3-brushed-betaflight-1.png" alt="Components" class="img-responsive"></p>
        <p>If the version of Betaflight you have is 2.9.1,set ESC/Motor protocol to PWM on the Configuration Tab</p>
        <p><img src="/assets/img/f3-brushed-betaflight-2.png" alt="Components" class="img-responsive"></p>
        <p>For all these firmwares,you need to go to CLI and type this in</p>
        <pre>set motor_pwm_rate=4000
save</pre>
