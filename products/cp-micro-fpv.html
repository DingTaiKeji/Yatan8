        <h3>Binding & Flying Procedure</h3>
        <p>a.Turn on transmitter, create new mode and enter setup, the Mode must be D8.</p>
        <p><img src="/assets/img/micro-fpv-frsky-1.png" alt="Components" class="img-responsive"></p>
        <p>b. Power on quadcopter,red LED will flash rapidly on receiver after 6 seconds, the receiver is in ready for binding mode.Then turn on the transmitter, enter the binding mode, the red LED will turn solid, this means it has binded successfully with the default mode in SBUS.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Turn on the transmitter for 6 to 30 second to be binded in SBUS mode; Turn on the transmitter after 30 seconds to be binded in PPM mode. The flight controller will default SBUS mode.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><img src="/assets/img/micro-fpv-frsky-2.png" alt="Components" class="img-responsive"></p>
        <p>c.For each flight, turn on the transmitter firstly, then power on the quadcopter, if the receiver has a solid red LED,this means it is binded correctly,with RSSI and voltage telemetry.</p>
        <p><img src="/assets/img/micro-fpv-frsky-3.png" alt="Components" class="img-responsive"></p>
        <p>d.With the SA switch in the middle position, the blue LED light turned on the flight controller,means the quadcopter is unlocked and ready to fly (armed).</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Crazepony 90mm BNF was set SA(CH5) to ARM/DISARM the motor before shipping, you can also customize it in cleanflight.</p>

        <p>You will need to know how to use the program cleanflight/betaflight.</p>
        <p>Most importantly,you should have 5.8G goggles to enjoy the FPV experience.</p>
        <p><strong>Q:</strong>Is this a complete rtf quad and does it include a battery?</p>
        <p>This is not complete RTF drone. You will need a transmitter to bind to it. FrSky Taranis X9D is recommended. A 200mAh battery is included, with a JST connector the same as Blade Inductrix TINY WHOOP drone racing.</p>
        <p><strong>Q:</strong>can we buy the receiver separately?or replace it.</p>
        <p>The receiver is connected to the fc board with 3 wires (PPM/5V/GND).Unsolder them and solder in your preferred micro receiver.For example,receiver can be replaced with a Spektrum DSMX Satt.</p>
        <p><strong>Q:</strong>How do Ibind the FrSky X9D transmitter?</p>

        <p><strong>Q:</strong>Hello, has the item already comes with engines, control board and the camera of fpv?</p>
        <p>Yes, it comes with 4*720 coreless motors, F3 brushed flight controller and 40CH AIO FPV camera.</p>
        <p><strong>Q:</strong>Does it have race band?</p>
        <p>Yes, this BNF kit contain AIO camera and works on all 40CHs, which includes 8CH on race band.</p>
        <p><strong>Q:</strong>Does it include motor plug end,a jst 1.25mm 2 pin micro?</p>
