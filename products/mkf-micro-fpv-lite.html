        <p><strong>Upgrades 1:special sauce edition motors.</strong>At 17500kv these motors are considerably more powerful than almost all of the motors used for upgrading Tiny Whoop style aircraft. If you're flying a stock board, these are the fastest motors you can fly without encountering considerable oscilations.</p>
        <img src="/assets/img/mkf-micro-fpv-lite-2.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive">
        <p><strong>Upgrades 2:5.8g super mini AIO camera.</strong>120° FOV 600TVL camera with great low-light performance mounted to a 25mw 5.8GHz video transmitter.This camera weights ony 3.6g,1g lighter than FX798T.10° tilt camera mount designed.</p>
        <img src="/assets/img/mkf-micro-fpv-lite-3.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive">
        <p><strong>Upgrades 3:200mAh 35C Battery.</strong>best battery out there for these motors. Flight times vary depending on your flight style and mood at the time of your flight, but most pilots seem to get 2-4 minutes of fun out of a charge on these packs.</p>
        <img src="/assets/img/mkf-micro-fpv-lite-4.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive">
        <p><strong>Upgrades 4:Free of Soldering.</strong>Many people would ask us,does it come with plug in motors?The answer is yes.The plug connector is Pico JST 1.25,the same as the one on Tiny Whoop.BUT if you want to use the motors for tiny whoop,changing the wires position of the motors on font left and back right.</p>
        <img src="/assets/img/mkf-micro-fpv-lite-6.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive">
        <p>About the price - I charge 59 bucks for this setup. It's FUN!I wanted to provide this option for those who want a ready to fly drone without assembled.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>You could easily buy a Eachine E010 for $24, a spare motor set for $20 bucks,a spare crazepony aio cam for $28 bucks,a spare 200mah battery for $6 bucks and build this little quad yourself.</p>
